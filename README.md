Welcome to the repo of my second project, <strong>revo.fun</strong> ! In this project I have created a "sketchy gaming portal" website. Utilizing html, tailwind css, and typescript, I showcase three games. These games are:



- The Clicking Game
- Guess The Number
- Rock Paper Scissors

Enjoy the games! (cheers)

## 🌏 Start Gaming

Play the game by opening the deployed site [here](https://revou-fsse-feb25.github.io/milestone-2-kebejoan/index.html).

## 💻 Open This Project Locally

Feel free to open and run the project on your local machine!

1. Clone the repository first
   ```sh
   https://github.com/revou-fsse-feb25/milestone-2-kebejoan.git
2. Navigate to the folder in your CLI
   ```sh
   cd .\milestone-2-kebejoan\
3. Run the code command (might differ in your machine)
   ```sh
   code .

## 🔍 Overview

This project was done using HTML as a structure, Tailwind CSS as styling, and Typescript for logics/algorithm. Logics and algorithm was done using <strong>(hopefully/sort of)</strong> proper Typescript structuring (e,g. using Classes as a Game, Exporting and Importing Classes and Functions). Please do review my script source code. Project tree will be later in this documentation.

## 🔥Future Improvement

As I develop this project, some ideas come in mind that would not able to be implemented before the deadline. Those ideas are:

- **Game difficulty**: Currently the buttons to change the difficulty are available but is not functional.
- **Game restart**: Currently the button to restart the game is available. But it is just directly restart the whole page
- **Game scoring**: No scoring is saved. Future can be added
